	<h1>You Have Chosen Cup #2</h1>

	<p>
		You slowly sip from the cup. An overwhelming sweetness overtakes your palate. So much so that your teeth begin to hurt. Looking down at the ground, you see the ground begin to swell. A red liquid starts to emerge from the soil. You scoop up a handful and taste it out of curiosity and against your best judgement. It tastes sweet yet the aftertaste resembled blood. You spit it out. Suddenly, the liquid starts to flow out of the ground at an alarming rate. Before you know it, the liquid is waist high. You look around you and see that you are now in the middle of nowhere. It is as if you are in the middle of an ocean. The red liquid overtakes you. Where can you go? How long can you swim before tiring? That cup... red and sweet. Bitterness and panic overtake you.
