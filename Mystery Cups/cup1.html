	<h1>You Have Chosen Cup #1</h1>

	<p>
		As you take a sip, you close your eyes. The potion tasted burnt with a hint of dirt. It tasted as if it had been sprinkled moist grainy soil. You open your eyes. Darkness surrounds you. As your eyes adjust, you notice you are in a forest under a cloudy sky. The trees sway and leaves crackle. A howl of a wolf is heard in the distance. How did you get here? How do you escape this haunted forest? The cup had done this, or rather drinking what was in it. Oh, what a mistake that was.
