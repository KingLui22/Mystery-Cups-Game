	<h1>You Have Chosen Cup #4</h1>

	<p>
		Water. This cup is full of just normal water. Is this some kind of joke? The ground below your feet suddenly crumbles. You fall through the floor and into a body of water. Gasping, you swim up to the surface and look around. Around you are just small bodies of water and shallow patches of land covered in patches of luscious green grass. You think to yourself how odd, but yet pleasant it all is. Finding a small patch of land. It is muddy and you couldn't help clasp it in your hands. The sky is cloudy. Are you trapped here? Would it be so bad?...
