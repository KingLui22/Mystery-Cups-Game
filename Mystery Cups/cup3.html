	<h1>You Have Chosen Cup #3</h1>

	<p>
		The liquid from this cup was stale and plain. It was dark and unimpressive. Maybe you just haven't tried enough to feel or see its effects. Before you know it, the cup is empty. You look at the other three cups. Did something go wrong? You start reaching the table that holds the cups. Slowly... and then slower. You breath shallows and your joints stiffen. Inches away from the table, you are frozen. You cannot move. Your skin starts to harden and turn grey. Is this the cups liquid? Did it have a delay effect? You drank it all. You are unable to move. Regret and confusion. Will you make for a good statue?
